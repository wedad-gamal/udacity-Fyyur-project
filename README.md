## Fyyur

## Introduction

Fyyur is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Your job is to build out the data models to power the API endpoints for the Fyyur site by connecting to a PostgreSQL database for storing, querying, and creating information about artists and venues on Fyyur.

## Overview

This app was missing one thingâ€¦ real data! While the views and controllers are defined in this application, now it connecting to the database and displays real data:

- creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
- searching for venues and artists.
- learning more about a specific artist or venue.

## Tech Stack (Dependencies)

### 1. Backend Dependencies

Our tech stack will include the following:

- **virtualenv** as a tool to create isolated Python environments
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** to be our ORM library of choice
- **PostgreSQL** as our database of choice
- **Python3** and **Flask** as our server language and server framework
- **Flask-Migrate** for creating and running schema migrations
  You can download and install the dependencies mentioned above using `pip` as:

```
pip install virtualenv
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install postgres
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-Migrate
```

> **Note** - If we do not mention the specific version of a package, then the default latest stable package will be installed.

### 2. Frontend Dependencies

You must have the **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/) for our website's frontend. Bootstrap can only be installed by Node Package Manager (NPM). Therefore, if not already, download and install the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Windows users must run the executable as an Administrator, and restart the computer after installation. After successfully installing the Node, verify the installation as shown below.

```
node -v
npm -v
```

Install [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) for the website's frontend:

```
npm init -y
npm install bootstrap@3
```

## Development Setup

1. **Download the project starter code locally**

```
git clone https://github.com/wedad-gamal/udacity-Fyyur-project.git

```

2. **Initialize and activate a virtualenv using:**

```
python -m virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

> **Note** - In Windows, the `env` does not have a `bin` directory. Therefore, you'd use the analogous command shown below:

```
source env/Scripts/activate
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the development server:**

```
export FLASK_APP=myapp
export FLASK_ENV=development # enables debug mode
python3 app.py
```

5. **Verify on the Browser**<br>
   Navigate to project homepage [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) or [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
